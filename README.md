# Horiseon

The Horiseon webpage is for a company that helps businesses optimize their searchability.

## Link
[Horiseon Website](https://seattlesal.github.io/Horiseon/)

## Optmized search engine
Searchability of the site was improved by the following:
* update title in head
* add meta description with keywords
* added alt tags for images (also useful for accessibility)

## Accessibility Standards
The website is accessible using the following:
* images have alt tags describing the image
* images have title tags to describe the image
* image file sizes are small for better web performance and faster upload

## Semantic HTML elements
* The html uses the following semantic elements in the following order:
    header
    nav
    main
    section
    aside
    footer

## CSS Styling
* The CSS utilizes html semantic tags where it makes sense instead of creating unnecessary classes.
* Classes are reused where they make sense such as "content-box" "benefit-box".
